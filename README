Add this file to config/initializers folder of your project

This patch handles backward compatibility for the method "find" with :first, :last, :all, which have been removed from MongoMapper/Plucky (its owner says, but I checked it actually never existed), as well as compatibility with ActiveRecord. My attempt to add it didn't get any support from the gem owner.

Add this patch if you experience problems migrating your project from ActiveRecord to Mongo. 

Also, the patch helps to run FactoryGirl associations in Cucumber with MongoMapper, which have been known not to be possible before. 

Example of FactoryGirl associations:

 | title      | user                       |
