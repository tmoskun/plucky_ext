Add this file to config/initializers folder of your project

This patch handles backward compatibility for the method "find" with :first, :last, :all, which have been removed from MongoMapper/Plucky (its author says, but I checked it actually never existed), as well as compatibility with ActiveRecord. My attempt to add it didn't get any support from the gem owner. 

In particular, the patch helps to run FactoryGirl associations in Cucumber with MongoMapper, which have been known not to be possible before. 

Example of FactoryGirl associations:

 | title      | user                       |
