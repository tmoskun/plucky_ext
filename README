This patch handles backward compatibility for the method "find" with :first, :last, :all, which have been removed from MongoMapper/Plucky, as well as compatibility with ActiveRecord. My attempt to put it back didn't get any support from the gem owner. 

In particular, the patch helps to run FactoryGirl associations in Cucumber with MongoMapper, which have been known not to be possuble before. 

Example of FactoryGirl associations:

 | title      | user                       |
