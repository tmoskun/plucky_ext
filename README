This patch handles backward compatibility for the method "find" with :first, :last, :all, which were removed from MongoMapper/Plucky, as well as compatibility with ActiveRecord. My attempt to put it back didn't get any support from the gem owner. 

In particular, the patch helps to run FactoryGirl associations in Cucumber with MongoMapper, which have been known not to be supported before. 

Example of FactoryGirl associations:

 | title      | user                       |
